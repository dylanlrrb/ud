Lesson Review


Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a powerful algorithm for classification which also finds the best boundary. We explored topics related to Maximum Margin Classifier, Classification with Inseparable Classes, and Kernel Methods

This lesson covered the following topics.

Minimizing distances
Error functions and the use of the Preceptron algorithm
The C parameter
Polynomial Kernal
RBF Kernal
SVMs in sklearn

Glossary
Key Term	Definition
C	Also referred to as the C hyper-parameter - determines how flexible we are willing to be with the points that fall on the wrong side of our dividing boundary. Large C is mostly the classification error. Small C is mostly margin error.
Classification error	An error in prediction caused by a false negative response or a false positive response.
Error function	Classification error + margin error. Used to minimize SVG
Gamma	A hyperparameter that we tune during training to alter the type of curve from wide ones to very narrow.
Kernal Trick	A more efficient and less expensive way to transform data into higher dimensions, especially in the SVM algorithm
Marthin error	The distance between the 2 boundary lines and prediction line. Use to minimize gradient descent
Ploynomial Kernel	A kernel function commonly used with SVM that allows learning of non-linear models.
RBF	Radial Basis Functions are used in machine learning to find a non-linear classifier or regression lines, especially in SVM.
