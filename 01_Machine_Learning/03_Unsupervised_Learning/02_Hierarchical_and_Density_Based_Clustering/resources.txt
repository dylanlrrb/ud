In this video, we first discussed the advantage and disadvantages of hierarchical clustering.

Advantages:
The resulting hierarchical clustering representations are very informative. They provide us additional ability to visualize the structure of the dataset.
It is very potent when the dataset contains real hierarchical relationships.
Disadvantages:
It is sensitive to outliers and noise so data needs to be cleaned up beforehand.
It is computationally intensive O(N^2)O(N

Visualizing DBSCAN Clustering: incredible Visualization of DBSCAN clustering. Allows you to change its parameters and see how it works on various datasets. Highly recommended!

Advantage of DBSCAN
No need to specify the number of clusters.
It's flexible in the shapes and sizes of clusters.
It handles noise.
It handles outliers.
Disadvantage of DBSCAN
Border points that are reachable from two clusters are assigned to the cluster that finds them first. It's not guaranteed to return the same clustering.
It has difficulty finding clusters of varying densities.
For data with varying densities, you can use a variation of DBSCAN called HDBSCAN. Read this paper if you are interested in HDBSCAN: Hierarchical density based clustering
