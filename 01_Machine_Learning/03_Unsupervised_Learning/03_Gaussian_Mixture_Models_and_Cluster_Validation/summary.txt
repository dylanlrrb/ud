Course Overview
Clustering
Hierarchical and Density Based Clustering
Gaussian Mixture Models and Cluster Validation
Dimensionality Reduction and PCA
Random Projection and ICA
Lesson Overview
In this lesson, we will look at one more clustering technique called Gaussian Mixture Model clustering. It is a soft clustering algorithm, meaning every sample in the dataset will belong to every cluster but have different levels of membership in each cluster.

Gaussian Mixture Modeling clustering:

Looks at all the points in a dataset
And clusters based on the shape of a Gaussian distribution that the data points seem to take
In this lesson, you will:

Cluster data with Gaussian Mixture Models
Optimize Gaussian Mixture Models with Expectation Maximization
Understand the cluster analysis process
Evaluate results using cluster validation

-----

Lesson Recap
Congratulation on completing this lesson on Gaussian Mixture Model clustering and cluster validation. You can now:

Cluster data with Gaussian Mixture Models
Optimize Gaussian Mixture Models with Expectation Maximization
Understand the cluster analysis process
Evaluate results using cluster validation
You've learned to visualize your findings and interpret your results using the scikit-learn library and your own mathematical equations. Way to go!

Looking Ahead
In the next lesson, you will learn to refine your models using unsupervised learning techniques that transform your data instead of clustering. You'll also learn how to reduce the number of features in your dataset down to those that are most important for the questions you need to be answered.
