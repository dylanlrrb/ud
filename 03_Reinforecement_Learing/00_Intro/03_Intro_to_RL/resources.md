Have you ever done a Google image search of "Atari Breakout"? If not, [check it out](https://www.google.com/search?q=atari+breakout&client=firefox-b-ab&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjVnpqaid_VAhUN4GMKHRUJAkYQ_AUICigB&biw=1101&bih=732&dpr=2)! :)

### Optional Resources

- Read about [TD-Gammon](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse590hk/01sp/Readings/tesauro95cacm.pdf), one of the first successful applications of neural networks to reinforcement learning.
    
- Read about [AlphaGo Zero](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/), the state-of-the-art computer program that defeats professional human Go players.
    
- Learn about how reinforcement learning (RL) is used to play [Atari games](https://deepmind.com/research/dqn/).
    
- Read about [OpenAI's bot](https://blog.openai.com/dota-2/) that beat the worldâ€™s top players of [Dota 2](http://www.dota2.com/play/).
    
- Read about [research](https://deepmind.com/blog/producing-flexible-behaviours-simulated-environments/) used to teach humanoid bodies to walk.
    
- Learn about RL for [self-driving cars](http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/).
    
- To see an example of RL applied to finance, check out this [final project](https://github.com/ucaiado/QLearning_Trading) from a student who graduated from the [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009). You may also enjoy this [friendly introduction](http://www.wildml.com/2018/02/introduction-to-learning-to-trade-with-reinforcement-learning/) to learning to trade with reinforcement learning.
    
- Learn about RL for [telecommunication](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1740-low-power-wireless-communication-via-reinforcement-learning.pdf).
    
- Read [this paper](https://goo.gl/e3gaM2) that introduces RL for inventory management.


As part of this course, we will recommend excerpts from this [classic textbook on reinforcement learning](http://go.udacity.com/rl-textbook).

**Note that all of the suggested readings are optional!**

Check out this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/reinforcement-learning-an-introduction) to see Python implementations of most of the figures in the book.

Before transitioning to the next lesson, you are encouraged to read Chapter 1 (especially 1.1-1.4) of the [textbook](http://go.udacity.com/rl-textbook) to get a nice introduction to the field of reinforcement learning.
