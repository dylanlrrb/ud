# Overview of the ND Program

The Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree program is divided into four parts, giving you a thorough understanding of deep reinforcement learning, and covering some of the major topics.

## Part 1: Foundations of Reinforcement Learning

* * *

The first part begins with a simple introduction to reinforcement learning. You'll learn how to define real-world problems as **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**, so that they can be solved with reinforcement learning.

Then, you'll implement classical methods such as **SARSA** and **Q-learning** to solve several environments in OpenAI Gym. You'll then explore how to use techniques such as **tile coding** and **coarse coding** to expand the size of the problems that can be solved with traditional reinforcement learning algorithms.

Train a car to navigate a steep hill using Q-learning.

## Part 2: Value-Based Methods

* * *

In the second part, you'll learn how to leverage neural networks when solving complex problems using the **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** algorithm. You will also learn about modifications such as **double Q-learning**, **prioritized experience replay**, and **dueling networks**. Then, you'll use what you’ve learned to create an artificially intelligent game-playing agent that can navigate a spaceship!

Use the DQN algorithm to train a spaceship to land safely on a planet.

You'll also get the **first project**, where you'll write an algorithm that teaches an agent to navigate a large world.

In Project 1, you will train an agent to collect yellow bananas while avoiding blue bananas.

All of the projects in this Nanodegree program use the rich simulation environments from the [Unity Machine Learning Agents (ML-Agents)](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2017/09/19/introducing-unity-machine-learning-agents/) software development kit (SDK). You will learn more about ML-Agents in the next concept.

## Part 3: Policy-Based Methods

* * *

In the third part, you'll learn about policy-based and actor-critic methods such as **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**, **Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)**, and **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG)**. You’ll also learn about optimization techniques such as **evolution strategies** and **hill climbing**.

Use Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) to train a robot to walk.

You'll learn from experts at NVIDIA about the active research that they are doing, to determine how to apply deep reinforcement learning techniques to finance. In particular, you'll explore an algorithm for optimal execution of portfolio transactions.

You'll also get the **second project**, where you'll write an algorithm to train a robotic arm to reach moving target positions.

![In Project 2, you will train a robotic arm to reach target locations.](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/June/5b1ea778_reacher/reacher.gif)

In Project 2, you will train a robotic arm to reach target locations.

## Part 4: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

* * *

Most of reinforcement learning is concerned with a single agent that seeks to demonstrate proficiency at a single task. In this agent's environment, there are no other agents. However, if we'd like our agents to become truly intelligent, they must be able to communicate with and learn from other agents. In the final part of this nanodegree, we will extend the traditional framework to include multiple agents.

You'll also learn all about **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** and master the skills behind DeepMind's AlphaZero.

You'll also get the **third project**, where you'll write an algorithm to train a pair of agents to play tennis.

# Projects You Will Build

The most important part of this program is the hands-on approach to learn. We've worked closely with the engineers at Unity to ensure that the projects are exciting and allow you to demonstrate mastery of cutting-edge skills. All of the projects use the [Unity Machine Learning Agents (ML-Agents)](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) toolkit, which you can learn more about by watching the video below.

## Unity ML-Agents

[Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) is a toolkit for training intelligent agents in rich and realistic environments.
