# Study Plan

This course covers value-based methods in deep reinforcement learning and lasts 2 **weeks**. You can find all of the coding exercises from the lessons in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/Value-based-methods).

## Weeks 1

* * *

For the first two weeks, you will learn more about how deep learning is used to increase the complexity of the problems we can solve with reinforcement learning.

#### Lesson: Deep Q-Networks

In this lesson, you will learn all of the details behind the Deep Q-Networks (DQN) algorithm.

#### Readings

- Read this [scientific article](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~meeden/cs63/s15/nature15a.pdf) that describes Deep Q-Networks.
- Read the [research paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf) that first introduced the Deep Q-Learning algorithm.

#### Resources

- Learn more about Deep Q-Learning and Google DeepMind by watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN1d3qHMIEQ).

## Week 2

* * *

For the final week, you will focus on the project: Navigation.

# Deep RL for Robotics

Watch the video below to hear how deep RL is being applied in robotics from **Dana Sheahen.**

_Dana is an electrical engineer with a Masters in Computer Science from Georgia Tech. Her work experience includes software development for embedded systems in the Automotive Group at Motorola, where she was awarded a patent for an onboard operating system._

In the next lesson, you'll learn all about **Deep Q-Networks**.
