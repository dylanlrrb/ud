re-do cat dog app with mobile net and tensorflow js,
  go thriugh tensor flow tutorials
  figure out how to train on PC then use in app with webcam
  figure out deploy scripts for demo projects
  add deploy scripts to other demos nad make sure demos are mobile responsive too

Make a notebook exploring all these style transfer methods (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y54wAlE04qU)
condenser networks
Then make a real time web app for style transfer
